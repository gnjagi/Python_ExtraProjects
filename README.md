# Student Submission Repository

Welcome to the Student Submission Repository! This repository is intended for students to submit their extra credit assignment/work in Python (.py) or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format.

## Submission Guidelines

1. **File Naming Convention**: 
   - All submitted files must follow the naming format: `name_extra01.py` or `name_extra01.ipynb` or `name_extra02.py` or `name_extra02.ipynb`.
   - Replace `name` with your first name or username.

   **Examples**:
   - `john_extra01.py`
   - `jane_extra01.ipynb`

2. **How to Submit Your Work**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Create or edit your file with the appropriate naming convention.
   - Add, commit, and push your changes:
     ```bash
     git add <your-file>
     git commit -m "Add my submission: <your-file>"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Check for Errors**: 
   - Ensure that your file follows the naming convention. If it doesnâ€™t, the push will fail, and it will not be evaluated. 

## Important Notes

- Make sure to commit your changes frequently to avoid losing your work.
- Enjoy!

## Happy coding!
